#  Traffic Volume Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

##  Project Overview

This project predicts **traffic volume** based on weather conditions, time, and environmental factors using multiple **Machine Learning and Deep Learning models**.

The system compares several models such as **Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR, KNN, and LSTM**, selects the best performing one, and allows users to make predictions through an **interactive Streamlit web application**.

The goal of the project is to analyze how different factors like **weather, time of day, and holidays influence traffic congestion**.

#  Models Implemented

The project trains and compares several models:

| Model                           | Type                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Linear Regression               | Machine Learning            |
| Decision Tree                   | Machine Learning            |
| Random Forest                   | Machine Learning            |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)       | Machine Learning            |
| Support Vector Regression (SVR) | Machine Learning            |
| XGBoost                         | Gradient Boosting           |
| LSTM                            | Deep Learning (Time-Series) |

The model with the **lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** is selected as the best model.

#  Features Used for Prediction

The model uses the following input features:

* Temperature
* Rainfall in last hour
* Snowfall in last hour
* Cloud coverage
* Hour of the day
* Day of the month
* Month
* Weekday
* Holiday indicator
* Weather conditions

These features help the model understand **patterns affecting traffic volume**.

---

#  Model Training

The training script:

```
train_models.py
```

Performs the following steps:

1. Loads the dataset
2. Preprocesses the data
3. Converts categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**
4. Splits data into training and testing sets
5. Trains multiple machine learning models
6. Evaluates models using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
7. Saves the best model for prediction

# Model Comparison

The project generates a visualization comparing the performance of each model.

Example output:

* **Random Forest**
* **XGBoost**
* **SVR**
* **KNN**
* **LSTM**

The results are stored in:

```
images/model_comparison.png
```

# 🌐 Streamlit Web Application

A **Streamlit web app** allows users to interactively predict traffic volume.

Users can input:

* Temperature
* Rain / Snow
* Cloud percentage
* Time of day
* Holiday status
* Weather conditions

The model then predicts **expected traffic volume**.
